# DeFacebook
DeFacebook is an experimental Chrome plugin to help people curb their usage of Facebook. The extension displays a count of the number of Facebook news feed items you have seen and as the number increases, colors, text, and content load time are all degraded in order to neutralize addictive design patterns and make usage more frustrating. The feed item counter will reset if you stay away from Facebook for an hour. 

If there is interest we will make the interventions configurable and expand the plugin to work on other newsfeed driven sites. Email barber5@illinois.edu with comments and suggestions.
